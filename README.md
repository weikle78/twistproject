# twistproject

Matt Chumsena, Morgan Perez

The learning objectives were to be able to work with a client from start to finish and be able to facilitate what they want and make that happen

On this project I built the room and session aspects from start to finish and most of the schedule area as well.  We always tried to collaborate with eachother and helped to succeed in the project.

We had a lot of problems.  Some like GitHub we were able to get through by working together and others we needed your help in trying to solve the problem.

We need to implement the schedule aspect of the project, make the home page better astheically and use drop boxes or tabs to make navigating the site easier.

If I had to do this project over again, I would spend a little more time on the planning phoase and figuring the stle and what the variable names we where to use.  Also, I would not use work from the older project to start this one and go from scratch.
